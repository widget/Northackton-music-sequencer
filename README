This project is for the software of Northackton's first project, a
pysical music sequencer.  This is comprised of several parts:

* Reading user input via a webcam
* Generating audio output

The audio output is generated using the Arduino Mega running the
Step_Sequencer.pde sketch provided, with servos on pins 22-25.  This
cannot run from USB.

The user input is read from the seqc application.  It is built from
the source provided in the following steps:

1. Install OpenCV (libcv, libhighgui, libaux) and dev dependencies
2. Run autogen.sh
3. Run ./configure
4. Make
